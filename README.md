# STM32 Bare-Metal Projects

This repository documents my journey learning STM32 firmware
development using direct register-level programming without HAL.

Each project includes:
- Register calculations
- Memory map tracing
- Bit manipulation logic
- Implementation reasoning

Target board: STM32 Nucleo-F446RE

Projects will progressively cover GPIO, timers, communication
interfaces and advanced peripherals.
